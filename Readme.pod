=head1 Sojolicious

Sojolicious is a toolkit for the federated social web, containing
plugins for the powerful web framework L<Mojolicious>
written in Perl.

=head2 Goal

Sojolicious mainly focus on support for the L<OStatus|http://ostatus.org/>
meta protocol and aims for a straight forward implementation of all
surrounding specifications.

The design goal is to make all plugins useful on their own,
as separated building blocks of OStatus, while playing well
with each other. All plugins are application and storage agnostic,
providing event driven hooks for usage.

All plugins have no requirements other than L<Mojolicious> and Perl 5.8
(core modules).

Sojolicious is in its early stages and work in progress. There are missing
parts currently developed and existing parts reworked.

=head2 Synopsis

  package MySocialApp;
  use Mojolicious;

  sub startup {
    my $app = shift;

    # Load Plugins
    $app->plugin('webfinger' => { host => 'sojolicio.us' });
    $app->plugin('salmon' => { host => 'sojolicio.us',
		               secure => 1 });

    my $r = $app->routes;

    # Establish webfinger url
    $r->route('/webfinger',uri => 'q')->webfinger;

    # Esablish Salmon Endpoints:
    my $salmon = $r->route('/salmon');
    $salmon->route('/:user/all-replies')->salmon('all-replies');

    $app->plugins->add_hook(
      'on_salmon_follow' => sub {
        ... # You received a follow request
      };
    );

  };

  package main;
  MySocialApp->start;

As Sojolicious is in its early stages, there is currently work on
support for C<ActivityStreams>, C<OAuth>, C<PubsubHubbub> and C<Portable Contacts>.
There are plans to expand the scope to other social protocols, for example C<OExchange>.
