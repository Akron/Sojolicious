=head1 Sojolicious

Sojolicious is a toolkit for the federated social web, containing
plugins for the powerful web framework L<Mojolicious>
written in Perl.


=head2 Synopsis

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # Load Plugins
  plugin 'Webfinger';
  plugin 'PubSubHubbub';
  plugin 'Salmon';

  # Esablish Salmon Endpoints:
  group {
    under '/salmon';
    (any '/:acct/mentioned')->salmon('mentioned');
    (any '/:acct/all-replies')->salmon('all-replies');
    (any '/signer')->salmon('signer');
  };

  # Add pubsubhubbub callback url
  (any '/pubsub')->pubsub;

  hook on_salmon_follow => sub {
    # ... You received a follow request
  };

  hook on_pubsub_content => sub {
    my ($c, $type, $dom) = @_;
    # ... You receive feed information you subscribed to
  };

  app->start;


=head2 Goal

Sojolicious mainly focus on support for the L<OStatus|http://ostatus.org/>
meta protocol and aims for a straight forward implementation of all
surrounding specifications.

The design goal is to make all plugins useful on their own,
as separated building blocks of OStatus, while playing well
with each other. All plugins are application (despite the fact
that they are Mojolicious plugins) and storage agnostic,
providing event driven hooks for usage.

Some plugins will become separated distributions, in case this is useful.

See L<sojolicio.us|http://sojolicio.us/> for recent updates.
